/*
366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.



Example:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]

          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \
      4   5

Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]


Explanation:

1. Removing the leaves [4,5,3] would result in this tree:

          1
         /
        2


2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:

          1


3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:

          []

/*
For this question we need to take bottom-up approach. The key is to find the height of each node. Here the definition of height is:
The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf. --CMU 15-121 Binary Trees

I used a helper function to return the height of current node. According to the definition, the height of leaf is 0. h(node) = 1 + max(h(node.left), h(node.right)).
The height of a node is also the its index in the result list (res). For example, leaves, whose heights are 0, are stored in res[0]. Once we find the height of a node, we can put it directly into the result.

UPDATE:
Thanks @adrianliu0729 for pointing out that my previous code does not actually remove leaves. I added one line node.left = node.right = null; to remove visited nodes

UPDATE:
There seems to be some debate over whether we need to actually "remove" leaves from the input tree. Anyway, it is just a matter of one line code. In the actual interview, just confirm with the interviewer whether removal is required.
